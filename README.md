# smart-drain website

This website is going to be used as an addition to a smart drain system, designed by group 245 of the course 4WBB0 at TU/e in 2023.

This website can be used to view how much water a person has used while showering, as well as being able to see how much water has been used over for example the course eof a week, the average water used or the progression of how much water is being used. This offers extra insight for the user, and therefore incentivizes sustainable behaviour.

This project is still under construction.
